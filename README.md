## Googling
* Always start your question with `how to`, `what is`, `whats the difference between`;
* Always make your question in english, the chances to find the solution for your problem will be hugely bigger;
* Always be short and concise in your googling, larger sentences normally are not successful;
  * `how to perform a loop in python`
  * `how to scrapy content in python`
  * `how to left join in postgres`
  * `what is scrapy`
  * `what is OOP`
  * `what is functional programming`
  * `whats the difference between python and sql`
  * `whats the difference between OOP and Structured programming`
* In case of doubt use google translate;
  

**Remeber. There is no such a thing like `dumb question`**.
If you have a very specific question or did not found what do you expect, than, I'm your guy. But trust me, google is better.

## Programming
### Logic Operations
* if;
* elif;
* else;
* while;

At the end of the course, should be able to understand and apply all structures;
### Functions
* Naming variables;
* Naming functions clearly;
* Do only one thing inside a function;

After the end of this concepts, do a small project. The project should be modulated in functions.

Tips: Calculator, Guessing Game;

### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Study all main concepts:

* Abstraction;
* Encapsulation;
* Inheritance;
* Polymorphism;

Understand all key concepts, not completly but a general idea. Create a small project using OOP paradigm.

### Clean Code Concepts

* Read briefly the book;
* Search for:
  * SOLID;
  * KISS;
  * DRY;
  * YAGNI;
  * TDD;

Apply the concepts in the previous code. 

-------
## Command Line

* ls;
* pwd;
* cd;

* branch;
* checkout;

## SQL Postgres
To the beginning I will provide you a database to query

### Data Manipulate Language (DML)
* selects;
* where;
* aggregation functions;
* groupby;
* joins;
  * Self join;
  * Inner join;

## Final Project
Create a webpage scraper generic (your choice, I can suggest).

Requisites:
* All in OOP;
* Versioned trough git;
* Create tables to store the information in Postgres;
* Create specific querys to give insights about the data;
* Access these querys programmatically;
